## Don’t permit the bulge

<!-- fig. 4.4.1 -->
<!-- fig. 4.4.2 -->
This formation, which may occur anywhere on the board, is explosive in shape terms. The plays 1 make a net difference of four cutting points.

<!-- fig. 4.4.3 -->
The bulge of 3.5G, that is, the marked White stone, is a key point in many shapes.

<!-- fig. 4.4.4 -->
If Black 1 is played there, Black A, White B, will saddle White with two dangerous cutting points. Compare with the previous diagrams.

<!-- fig. 4.4.5 -->
(Left) Black 4 should really be at 5 in this case, but Black 6 is a serious shape error. White 7 sets up a White play at A, to which Black has no very good reply. This is the sort of bulge one shouldn’t permit to the opponent.

<!-- fig. 4.4.6 -->
(Right) Black 6 played at the bulge point guards Black’s shape and attacks White’s. If White plays 7 and 9, Black sets White a problem up to 16. Black’s pincer would now be better at A, which is why Black 4 is wrong.

<!-- fig. 4.4.7 -->
However in this position the bulge point A isn’t important for either player. Black should play at 1 as shown; Black A, White B, Black C reveals an empty triangle.

<!-- fig. 4.4.8 -->
(Right) White 1 overlaps in effect with the triangle stone, and violates another proverb: don’t peep both sides of a bamboo joint. It would be better placed at D, since Black has no interest in playing at 1.
