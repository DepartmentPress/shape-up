## The wedge weakness

<!-- fig. 1.3.1 -->
The table shape is sometimes worse than the bamboo joint would be, with a wedge weakness. In this case Black is powerless when White wedges in at the key point 1.

<!-- fig. 1.3.2 -->
There is no way to cover all three cuts A, B and C.

<!-- fig. 1.3.3 -->
A related shape is often seen seen in a loose ladder tactic.

<!-- fig. 1.3.4 -->
White can capture Black. The placement 1 is on the point corresponding to the wedge weakness.

<!-- fig. 1.3.5 -->
Suppose White misses the chance of the loose ladder, and crawls out at 1 instead. Black should now make a bamboo joint (left).

<!-- fig. 1.3.5 -->
The weakness of the table shape against White 5 is evident. The weak point at 5 has remained: it is just the method to exploit it that changes (White 3 at 5 is good shape but doesn’t capture Black’s cutting stones).
