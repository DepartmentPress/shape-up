## Double-purpose plays

_Killing two birds with one stone_ is a proverb in many languages. If you want your stones to work harder for you, place them where their purpose in life (or death) isnâ€™t limited to just one future direction of play.

<!-- fig. 13.4.1 -->
In the left-hand diagram Black attacks White single-mindedly.

<!-- fig. 13.4.2 -->
On the right Black 2 sets up subsequent plays at A to attack, or B to build a framework. This is more reasonable. The points A and B are like miai (13.3).

<!-- fig. 13.4.3 -->
If White challenges Black on the upper side with 3, Black 4 has a double purpose (attack White, build up the top right), and Black 6 has three aims (attack the White groups to left and right, and avoid getting shut in).

A well-masked trap in the endgame (White 4 should be at 7). Black 9 sets up two kos, both dangerous to White (who has to find the first ko threat).
