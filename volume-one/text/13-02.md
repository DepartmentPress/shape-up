## 123 and use of threats

<!-- fig. 13.2.1 -->
<!-- fig. 13.2.2 -->
Both of these sequences allow White to escape. But in the left-hand diagram Black gains more outside influence. Since the exchange of White 1 for Black 2 in that diagram isn’t necessary, it should be omitted.

> ### 123 Principle
> Don’t play 1-2-3, just play at 3.

(Left) There is no good reason to play 1 here. It loses Black a liberty, and a ko threat; and also some potential for later play with Black at 2 or one point above.

<!-- fig. 13.2.4 -->
(Right) A cross-cut: see p.103 for Black 3 connecting solidly after Black 1 atari. A very common case of the principle is: ‘don’t play atari and then connect’. That can look like planless play. Black 3 in this diagram is part of a plan, to sacrifice one stone, with White A, Black B, White C, Black D. That builds strong shape for Black in one direction. Quite generally, if your play 1 has an obvious answer, you should have play 3 already lined up

> One of the key proverbs is _don’t go back to patch up_. Effective play normally aims to generates sustainable forward momentum.
