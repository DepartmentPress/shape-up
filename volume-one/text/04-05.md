<!-- fig. 4.5.1 -->
White 3 is a _butting_ play, hitting a black stone head on.

<!-- fig. 4.5.2 -->
Up to 12, White’s shape is very bad. White has made the same type of mistake twice.

<!-- fig. 4.5.3 -->
(Left) In general White 2, butting towards the centre, is a pattern of bad shape.

<!-- fig. 4.5.4 -->
(Right) White’s shape here is poor. After Black’s double _hane_ with 6, White must defend, rather than play 9 at A.
