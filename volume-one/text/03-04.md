## Compound shapes

<!-- fig. 3.4.1 -->
Imagine a single stone sitting in the middle of the board somewhere. The most important friendly and enemy stones as far as it is concerned are those as close as the two marked ones, or on the other ‘x’ points.

What we call a compound shape is a shape of three stones of the same colour, not containing any solid connection, that can be made by adding two plays such as the marked ones to the central stone. All 15 types are listed in the next section, to refer to at need.

> In these examples, an underlying White shape (the marked stones) is properly connected, unless Black is strong nearby.White presumably made them when that was true, and simply failed to check that later developments hadn’t changed the > tactical position.

> In fact the plays Black 1, when put in place, clearly do cut White. This sort of mistake by White is quite common.
