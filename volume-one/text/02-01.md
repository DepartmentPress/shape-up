# Shape Basics

## Introduction: functions and comparisons

Chapter 1 showed some strong and useful shapes, but you need principles as well. The first steps in understanding shape come not with looking at specific patterns, but with the idea that certain plays work well, where others
disappoint.

<!-- fig 2.1.1 -->
The one-point jump White 1 in the left-hand diagram doesnâ€™t allow White to keep the two Black stones separate: after Black 6 Black will be able to play at A or B.

<!-- fig. 2.1.2 -->
But the diagonal play 1 (right) works perfectly.

<!-- fig 2.1.3 -->
The one-point jump is the way to defend the two marked stones, since the diagonal play allows Black the snapback threat at 2.
<!-- fig 2.1.4 -->

<!-- fig 2.1.5 -->
Black should use the diagonal play 1 (left) to capture the two White stones.

<!-- fig 2.1.6 -->
Playing down towards the edge (right) is clumsy: Black 3 is needed because of the threat of White A. Now Black cannot capture a white stone on the edge, a big endgame play that also creates a cutting point.
