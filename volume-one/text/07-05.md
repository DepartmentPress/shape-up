## Strike at the waist of a knight’s move

<!-- fig. 7.5.1 -->
This is a single proverb, with a pair of recommendations. With a choice of how to cut White’s knight’s move, Black is urged to make the cutting play shown at the ‘waist’.

<!-- fig. 7.5.2 -->
This does depend on the ladder (right): Black needs to have a good ladder, or be happy to sacrifice the stone played (e.g p.104).

<!-- fig. 7.5.3 -->
(Left) This is the other cut at a ‘waist’ (a mistranslated Japanese term that has stuck); again a ladder may matter.

<!-- fig. 7.5.4 -->
(Right) In this case however the alternative cut is also good shape.

<!-- fig. 7.5.5 -->
The footsweep, seen in 5.4 and 6.4, is often the occasion for this pattern. (Left) In this case Black 2 at 3, White at A is dangerous for Black.

<!-- fig. 7.5.6 -->
A set pattern in the Chinese-style opening. Now A is the key point for both.
