## How to connect

<!-- fig. 2.5.1 -->
What if anything is wrong with White 1 here?

<!-- fig. 2.5.2 -->
A fundamental question is: how to connect, given a range of possible plays such as A to D. White certainly ought not to get cut round here, but which is the right play? The solid connection A demonstrates no ambition to be efficient, but allows Black nothing at all in the way of later forcing moves.

<!-- fig. 2.5.4 -->
The hanging connections C (left) and B (right) both allow Black a peep 2. If White is strong to the right, B may be better; the peep is a waste if it gets swallowed up. After C White has no reason to connect with 3.

The choice D (left) is the normal good shape. This indirect connection is supported by two ladders (and here a net, too).

The Black forcing move (right) is not worth very much: there isnâ€™t a good way to follow it up.
