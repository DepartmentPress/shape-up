## Play at the centre of three stones

<!-- fig. 4.6.1 -->
These next sections are pivotal, and integrate ideas from all the first four chapters. White 1 is good shape for moving out. It anticipates the double hane, and prepares a table shape. This stone stone symmetrically placed at the centre of three stones defends a vital point.

<!-- fig. 4.6.2 -->
(Right) The single marked White stone is also more efficient than the two marked Black stones.

<!-- fig. 4.6.3 -->
<!-- fig. 4.6.4 -->
The triangles formed by these marked stones are ideal examples of attacking shape (left), and defence at the key point (right).

<!-- fig. 4.6.5 -->
(Left) Black takes the key point, and Whiteâ€™s eye shape is gone (White A, Black B leaves a false eye, Black 3 could be omitted).

<!-- fig. 4.6.6 -->
(Right) Compare with this basic eye-stealing pattern and the double table (1.1).
