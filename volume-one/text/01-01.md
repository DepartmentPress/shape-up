# Table Shapes

## Three strong shapes

This chapter introduces a number of strong shapes. Strong shape isn’t the
only kind of good shape, but this is a place to start.

<!-- fig. 1.1.1 -->
The basic table shape.

<!-- fig. 1.1.2 -->
The double table, a perfect eye shape, and made up of two superposed table shapes, the second one marked.

<!-- fig. 1.1.3 -->
The bamboo joint, differing from the table shape only as marked.

<!-- fig. 1.1.4 -->
When White plays 2 here, the White group develops perfect shape.

<!-- fig. 1.1.5 -->
If White’s strategy requires subsequent plays pushing in the centre, they are easy to find, and the marked stone is exactly placed.
