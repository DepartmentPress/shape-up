## Restrained shapes

<!-- fig. 5.4.1 -->
This butting play (left) is for special purposes only. It doesnâ€™t aim to get over the gain line. It loses out on influence, because Black 1 ends up so close to White.

<!-- fig. 5.4.2 -->
The diagonal attachment (right) is still something of a loss,
and should be used to attack. In each case Black 1 is a local concession.

<!-- fig. 5.4.3 -->
The steel post (left) works well sometimes, when Black can defend territory to the left and also attack to the right.

<!-- fig. 5.4.4 -->
The footsweep (right) is a harderworking play, but has a weakness at A (see 7.5).

<!-- fig. 5.4.5 -->
<!-- fig. 5.4.6 -->
These are constructive plays for influence or central territory. They aim only for a reasonable result, pushing back the opponent. In fact there are real virtues in plays that leave the opponent wondering how to build power.
