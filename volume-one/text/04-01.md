## Play hane at the head of two stones

<!-- fig. 4.1.1 -->
The Black stone marked with a triangle is an example of the hane (‘hahnay’) play, round the end of your opponent’s stones, leaving a cutting point.

<!-- fig. 4.1.2 -->
(Right) Black 1 is hane at the head of two White stones, and Black 3 is a second hane. When it works, this double hane is a powerful way to play.

<!-- fig. 4.1.3 -->
(Left) White must defend at 6, so Black succeeds, bending White back through 90 degrees.

<!-- fig. 4.1.4 -->
(Right) After a 3-3 invasion, Black may play double hane with 4 and 6, since Black B retakes the corner if White now plays A.
