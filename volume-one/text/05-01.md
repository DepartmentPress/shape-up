## Approach plays and gain lines

Approach plays (kakari in Japanese) are the first elements learned in opening play. They can happen anywhere on the board.

Where they do occur, there is a confrontation, across a gain line, marked in these diagrams. One way to get a local advantage is to push your opponent back, relative to these lines.

These plays, which are the conventional _supported contact plays_, are then of primary interest. In each case Black 1 tries for the maximum advantage, measured by getting over the gain line, while remaining close enough to the initial Black stone to see some benefit from its proximity. Because of their importance, and the variety of possible outcomes, we devote two pages to each of them.
