## Two-point extension: the placement

<!-- fig. 11.1.1 -->
This chapter gives the other side of the story on the two-point extension. When it is cramped by two White stones, as shown in the left hand diagram, it can be attacked in many ways.

<!-- fig. 11.1.2 -->
The placement (right) at 1 or A is something of a revelation, when you first discover it.

<!-- fig. 11.1.3 -->
<!-- fig. 11.1.4 -->
Next if Black blocks at 2, White should play 3 in the left-hand diagram; the other choice (right) can be criticised.

<!-- fig. 11.1.4 -->
Black canâ€™t hope to resist as in the left-hand diagram.

<!-- fig. 11.1.5 -->
What about the righthand way?

<!-- fig. 11.1.6 -->
(Left) Black makes better shape with this choice of 4. White should just play 5, rather than A.

<!-- fig. 11.1.7 -->
(Right) This way of playing 3 is a little vulgar; the exchange of 3 and 4 benefits Black.

<!-- fig. 11.1.8 -->
There is also a chance Black will resist (left), leading to a wild position, both having bad shape.

<!-- fig. 11.1.9 -->
(Right) If Black plays 2 White 3 is inevitable.

<!-- fig. 11.1.10 -->
(Left) White can connect out either side, but is thin.

<!-- fig. 11.1.11 -->
(Right) Black blocks with the intention of sacrificing if necessary.

<!-- fig. 11.1.12 -->
<!-- fig. 11.1.13 -->
White 5 here is reasonable. But cutting at 9 just helps Black make good shape up to 14. White should attack on a larger scale than this.
