## Staircase connections

<!-- fig. 7.4.1 -->
Connecting solidly to leave no weakness is usually the prerogative of the attacker. We call the shape in the left-hand diagram a staircase connection.

<!-- fig. 7.4.2 -->
(Right) The result here is one seen in 7.1 The idea is therefore related to extending after a cross-cut (see 13.2 also): depending on the ladder Black 1 here may turn out to be superfluous, or better played as atari at 2.

<!-- fig. 7.4.3 -->
Let’s compare Black 10 here, which may seem slow, to double _hane_ at 11 (next diagram). In fact White is in a mess after Black 16, and Black solid.

<!-- fig. 7.4.4 -->
Following 4.1 blindly in this case isn’t as good. After 10 White is alive, and has the cut at A to aim at. If Black wants to play double _hane_, a second _hane_ play at 7, at the other end of White’s two-stone chain, must come first.
